#1) create a class Dog that takes a parameter `name` in its initializer (ie. dog = Dog('fido'))
# and saves that name to an instance variable.
#2) add a method to the Dog class called `speak` that prints out "Hello, my name is '<name goes here>"

#the main code should look like this

#dog = Dog('Mr. Peanutbutter')
#dog.speak()

#the output should look like:
#Hello, my name is Mr. Peanutbutter.

#given those constraints, implement the Dog class.

class Dog:
    def __init__(self):
        self.dog_name = 'Hello, my name is Mr. Peanutbutter.'

dog = Dog()
print(dog.dog_name)
