"""
Part 3:
You're given an empty list called `even_numbers`.
Loop through all numbers from 0 to 100 (inclusive).
If a number is even, append it to `even_numbers`.
By the end of your loop, `even_numbers` should contain all evens between 0 and 100 inclusive.
Finally, see if you can produce that same list of evens, but in only one line of code.
