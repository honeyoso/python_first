Part 2:
Create a function called `is_even` that takes in a number and returns True
if that number is even, otherwise return False.
Hint: this is often done using something called the "modulo operator." it is
a mathematical operator like the plus sign or minus sign, represented by the % sign.
here's an example of it in action:
    10 % 3  # this returns 1
    5 % 3   # this returns 2
Modulo is a fancy way of saying "take the remainder". So 10 % 3 = 1 could be
read as "the remainder of 10 divided by 3 is 1." Similarly, 5 % 3 is "the
remainder of 5 divided by 3" and that returns 2.
Think of how you could use this operator to check if a number is even or odd
and use it to implement is_even

    if x % 2 == 0:
        return "Booyah"
    else: x % 2 != 0
    return "Nope"


assert is_even(5) == False
